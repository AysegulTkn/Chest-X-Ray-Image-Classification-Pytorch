# Chest-X-Ray-Image-Classification-Pytorch

In this project, we are building a classifier to determine if a given chest X-Ray image is normal or not. <br>
For this, we will use data set from Kaggle.
The Dataset contains 5,863 chest X-Ray Images in .jpeg format. There are two categories, that are Pneumonia and Normal. For more details you can check [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
.
